    <p>varma uddaraju is the <strong>king</strong> of <b>andhra pradesh</b></p>
    <p>Ironically, in the midst of the <b>over-the-top</b> veneration and in spite of the pedestal 
        he has been placed on, it is his humility and <br/>the ability to cast it all 
        out <i>that has allowed</i> him to put forth his best performances on the international stage for over two decades. Having played across generations, Tendulkar started playing Test cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for millions.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>n a nutshell
        In the midst of all the constant
         adulation he has received over a 
         significantly transitional period
          for cricket, commercially and otherwise, 
          and in a sea of statistics that every 
          Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts, 
          it is sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps 
          the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the diamond. 
          <q>This uncommon blend of dedication</q>and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend that is <small>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</small>>.</p>
